FRisk
======================

Welcome to F(orgotten) Risk.  It is basic.

Documentation
-------------

This project is to remind myself of all the things I have forgotten and am forgetting about risk.  It will end up being a one stop shop for the 
fundamentals and allow me to chuck out all my course notes from the MTF.  It will also be the limit of what I will hold in (or near) memory and 
be the extent to which I will profess competence in discussions with practicioners.  I am writing it only for myself and so the explanations 
will be such that I understand them.  If it helps others then I am delighted but that will be a side effect only.  I will cover the following:

* [Historic Volatility](volatility.html)
* Pricing a Vanilla European Call (and Put) with Black Scholes
* Put-Call Parity
* Implied Volatility
* Greeks and the effect of fundamentals on options prices.
* Monte Carlo simulation
* VaR

Samples & documentation

There are explanations linked above and an automatically generated [API Reference](reference/index.html) for what that's worth.
